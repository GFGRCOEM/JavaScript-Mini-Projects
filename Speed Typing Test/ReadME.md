# Problem Statement: Speed Typing Test

In this project you have to create a basic UI where speed typing test would be taken and it should have a prebuilt paragraph which the user has to see and type. User need to type the paragraph in as fast as possible ways and then you will have to tell the speed of typing each word like words per second.
***Keep in mind that the prebuilt paragraph can not be selected and copy pasted. So hence use proper CSS tags for it.***.
