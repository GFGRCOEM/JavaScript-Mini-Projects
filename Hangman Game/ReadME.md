# Problem Statement: Hangman Game

The hangman game provides the user with three options to choose from. These options are – ‘Fruits’, ‘Animals’ and ‘Countries’. Once the user selects the option, the computer chooses a word from the corresponding category.

Now, the user has to guess the chosen word using the letter buttons provided on the screen. The user can make six wrong attempts before he loses the game.

If the user guesses the word, we display a winning message on the screen. If not, we display a lost message. Along with this message, we also provide the user with the solution and a button to start ‘New Game’.
