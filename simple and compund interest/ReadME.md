# Problem Statement: Simple and Compound Interest
# Simple Interest
Design a user interface where the user can input the principal amount, rate of interest, and time (in years). Calculate and display the simple interest using the formula: 
simpleInterest = principal*rate*time/100
# Compound Interest 
Create a user interface that allows the user to input the principal amount, rate of interest, time (in years), and the number of times interest is compounded per year. Calculate and display the compound interest using the formula:
compoundInterest = Principal(1 + Rate/n)^nt - Principal , where 
n is the number of times interest is compounded per year.
